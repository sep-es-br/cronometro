Also, this problem don't affect you if \"Show Firefox 4+ Titlebar\" is setted to \"enabled\" (of course losing some space).\n\n    I've filed Firefox Bug 730219 on 2012-02-24 about this.\n    This is discussed already in the Support Site, Issue 178.\n\n\n\nTesting tips:\nI's recommended (and very easy) to test any issue by opening a new Firefox window with a blank (fresh) profile! (You can leave open the main Firefox window, that wont be affected at all). Very useful to identify addons incompatibilities.\n\nSimply run this command:\n  firefox.exe -no-remote -profile \"c:\\_Firefox_temp_profile\"\n\n    Having another Fx window with a fresh profile can also be useful to try at will this and other addons without interfering with your main Fx window/profile.

Dialog can get pretty unresponsive at times and It will look like messed up, It's better to maximize it!)\n  The \"id\" value (with yellow bkg, showed for reference) at top of each tooltip is roughly equivalent to the corresponding DTD ENTITY ID.\n  Tips without \"id\" (cyan bkg) are the content of \"tooltiptext\" attributes (the ones that cannot include <tag>s)\nAnd for even messier look :-), and showing all popup-menus content at once: add also the word \"dlgPopups\" to that same preference.\nAt bottom it shows a new MenuList for seeing Popup-Notifications messages contained in main.properties file.\n*New!:* you can show _only_ this, using new (3rd) word: \"dlgNotifs\" (since version 3.1.1)\n(Also, most label-texts can be selected for copying with any of these '3 words')","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/164/164562.png?src=api&modified=1466030178","width":"700","height":"244","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/164/164562.png?src=api&modified=1466030178","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"70","caption":"Maximizing Content Space!
